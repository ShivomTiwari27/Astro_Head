# Astro Head

## Overview

This project is a simple HTML and CSS-based web page that displays a graphical representation of an astronaut's head. The project is designed to demonstrate basic web development skills, including layout design, CSS animations, and responsive design.

### The challenge

The challenge was to create a visually appealing and interactive design using only HTML and CSS. The design involves creating an astronaut's helmet with animated eyes that move dynamically.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Animations

### What I learned

In this project, I reinforced my understanding of:

- **CSS Flexbox:** Used for aligning and centering elements within the helmet and head.
- **CSS Animations:** Learned how to animate the eyes within the astronaut's helmet using keyframes.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensured that the design looks good across different screen sizes by setting the viewport and using responsive units.

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to:

- Add more details to the helmet and the astronaut's suit.
- Implement additional animations to create a more dynamic and engaging experience.
- Experiment with JavaScript to add interactivity.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - CSS Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This helped me understand Flexbox better.
- [CSS-Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is a great reference for Flexbox properties.
- [MDN Web Docs - CSS Animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations) - This helped me create the eye movement animation.
